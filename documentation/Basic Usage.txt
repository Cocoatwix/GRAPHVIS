PREREQUISITES:
Using GRAPHVIS requires a Python install with Pygame, which can be installed using pip. This program was tested using Python 3.10 and Pygame 2.1.2, though other versions should also work.

STARTING THE PROGRAM:
Launching graphvis.py directly or through the command line without any arguments will generate a random graph. Launching graphvis.py on the command line with the filename of a .graph file will load the graph into the program (see ".graph specs.txt" for more information on how .graph files are formatted).

USING THE PROGRAM:
 - Clicking and dragging off of the graph itself will move the view around.
 - Clicking and dragging on a graph node will drag the node around.
 - Scrolling in and out with the mouse wheel will zoom the view in and out, respectfully.
 - Pressing "P" on the keyboard will stop forces from acting on the graph, essentially "pausing" any updates. You can still move the view and nodes around while the graph is paused.
 - Pressing "L" on the keyboard will toggle labels on or off.
